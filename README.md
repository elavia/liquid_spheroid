# liquid_spheroid
	Julia and C++ code for the acoustic Helmholtz equation applied to liquid spheroids (prolate and oblate).
	This code use the executables of the Spheroidal wave functions of Adelman, Gumerov and Duraiswami
	(see http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0074).
	From inside a Julia shell start it and load the file "JUL.main.jl", this loads the core routines in
	"JUL.routines.jl" and "JUL.auxiliar.jl"
